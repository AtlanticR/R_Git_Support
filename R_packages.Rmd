## Introduction

Welcome to the session on creating and using R packages! Today, we'll explore how to create R packages for internal use, focusing on custom functions relevant to marine science.

## Basics of R Functions

### What is a Function?

A function is a reusable piece of code that performs a specific task. Here's an example of a simple function to calculate salinity:

```r
calculate_salinity <- function(conductivity, temperature) {
  # Example calculation
  salinity <- conductivity / (1 + 0.02 * (temperature - 25))
  return(salinity)
}
```

Creating Custom Functions
Let's create a function to calculate chlorophyll concentration:

```r
calculate_chlorophyll <- function(fluorescence) {
  # Example calculation
  chlorophyll <- fluorescence * 0.1
  return(chlorophyll)
}
```

Introduction to R Packages
What is an R Package?
An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that can be easily shared and reused.

Benefits of Using Packages
Reusability: Use the same functions across multiple projects.
Organization: Keep your code organized and maintainable.
Sharing: Easily share your code with others.
Creating a Simple R Package
Setting Up
Use the usethis and devtools packages to create a package structure:

```r
usethis::create_package("marineAnalysis")
```

Adding Functions
Add your custom functions to the package:

```r
# In R/calculate_salinity.R
calculate_salinity <- function(conductivity, temperature) {
  salinity <- conductivity / (1 + 0.02 * (temperature - 25))
  return(salinity)
}

# In R/calculate_chlorophyll.R
calculate_chlorophyll <- function(fluorescence) {
  chlorophyll <- fluorescence * 0.1
  return(chlorophyll)
}
```

Documentation
Use roxygen2 to document your functions:

```r
#' Calculate Salinity
#'
#' @param conductivity Conductivity measurement
#' @param temperature Temperature in degrees Celsius
#' @return Salinity value
#' @export
calculate_salinity <- function(conductivity, temperature) {
  salinity <- conductivity / (1 + 0.02 * (temperature - 25))
  return(salinity)
}

```

Building and Installing the Package
Building the Package
Build the package using devtools:

```r
devtools::build()
```
Installing the Package
Install the package locally:

```r
devtools::install()
```

Sharing and Collaboration
Version Control with Git
Use Git for version control to track changes and collaborate with others.

Sharing the Package
Share the package within your team or organization using GitHub or other platforms.

Downloading the Package from GitHub
You can download and install the package from GitHub using the following command:

```r
devtools::install_github("yourusername/marineAnalysis")
```
